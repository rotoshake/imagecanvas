# Legacy Systems Disabled

## Problem
Multiple collaborative systems were running simultaneously, causing:
- Operations being handled multiple times
- Conflicting save/load mechanisms
- Nodes not updating in other tabs
- Changes reverting on refresh

## Solution
Created `DisableLegacySystems.js` which:

1. **Disables CollaborativeManager**
   - Disconnects socket
   - Prevents all broadcasts
   - Stops auto-save

2. **Disables ActionManager**
   - Removes from canvas
   - Prevents operation interception

3. **Disables UnifiedOperationHandler**
   - Replaces with dummy class

4. **Disables TransactionManager**
   - Replaces with dummy class

5. **Disables CanvasActionManager broadcasts**
   - Overrides all broadcast methods

6. **Disables canvas broadcast methods**
   - Prevents direct broadcasting from canvas

## New Architecture Components

### Active Systems:
1. **NetworkLayer** - Handles all network communication
2. **OperationPipeline** - Single entry point for all operations
3. **MigrationAdapter** - Routes legacy calls to new system
4. **PersistenceHandler** - Handles saving/loading (NEW)

### How It Works:
1. All operations go through OperationPipeline
2. NetworkLayer broadcasts to other clients
3. PersistenceHandler auto-saves every 30 seconds or on changes
4. No competing systems = no conflicts

## Testing
After reloading with cache cleared:
1. Check console for "Disabled X legacy systems" message
2. Verify new architecture components are active
3. Test multi-tab sync - nodes should update in real-time
4. Test persistence - changes should survive refresh

## Status
✅ Legacy systems disabled
✅ New architecture is the only active system
✅ Persistence handler added for auto-save
✅ Should fix sync and persistence issues
