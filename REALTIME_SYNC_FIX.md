# Real-time Sync Fix

## Problems Found

1. **Wrong event names**: 
   - NetworkLayer was emitting `operation` but server expects `canvas_operation`
   - NetworkLayer was listening for `operation` but server emits `canvas_operation`

2. **Data structure mismatch**:
   - NetworkLayer sends `params` but server expects `data`
   - Server sends `data` but NetworkLayer expects `params`

3. **Poor persistence model**:
   - Treating it as "save/load" instead of real-time commits
   - Operations not being the source of truth

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed NetworkLayer event names
```javascript
// Changed from:
this.socket.emit('operation', data);
this.socket.on('operation', handler);

// To:
this.socket.emit('canvas_operation', data);
this.socket.on('canvas_operation', handler);
```

### 2. Fixed data structure
```javascript
// Changed operation structure to match server:
operation: {
    type: command.type,
    data: command.params,  // was 'params', now 'data'
    ...
}
```

### 3. Created OperationPersistence approach
Instead of traditional save/load, every operation:
- Is immediately sent to server
- Server stores it and broadcasts to all clients
- Canvas state is rebuilt by replaying operations

## Testing

Use `/tests/debug/realtime-sync-test.html` to verify:
1. Open test windows
2. Test node creation - should appear in both windows
3. Test node movement - should sync position

## What Should Work Now

1. **Real-time sync**: Actions in one tab should immediately appear in others
2. **Persistence**: Every action is committed to server immediately
3. **Consistency**: All clients see the same state

## If Still Not Working

Check the console for:
- `ðŸ“¤ Broadcast: node_move` - Operation being sent
- `ðŸ“¥ Received: node_move` - Operation being received
- Any error messages about wrong event names or data structures

The server must be running and both tabs must be in the same project.
