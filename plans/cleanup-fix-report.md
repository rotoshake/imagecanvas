# Database Cleanup Fix Report

## Issue
The cleanup button in the Canvas Navigator wasn't functioning properly - it was only cleaning up old operations with embedded image data, but not removing orphaned upload files, thumbnails, or transcodes.

## Root Cause
The server-side cleanup endpoint (`/database/cleanup`) had been disabled and replaced with a minimal implementation that only deleted old operations. The comprehensive cleanup code existed but was commented out.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Restored Full Cleanup Functionality
Re-implemented the cleanup endpoint with the following features:

- **Orphaned File Detection**: Scans all projects' canvas data to find referenced files, then identifies files in the database that are no longer referenced
- **Multi-location File Reference Check**: Checks multiple properties where file references might be stored:
  - `node.properties.serverFilename`
  - `node.properties.serverUrl`
  - `node.properties.src`
  - `node.properties.filename`

- **Comprehensive Cleanup**:
  - Deletes orphaned files from both database and disk
  - Removes old operations with embedded image data (older than 7 days)
  - Optionally deletes all thumbnails (when requested)
  - Cleans up orphaned transcode files

### 2. Safety Features
- **Dry Run Mode**: When `dryRun=true` is passed, shows what would be deleted without actually deleting
- **Delete All Thumbnails Option**: Only deletes all thumbnails when explicitly requested via `deleteAllThumbnails=true`
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs all operations for debugging and verification

### 3. Client-Side Integration
The Canvas Navigator UI already had the proper implementation:
- Shows cleanup dialog with options
- Supports dry run mode
- Clears client-side caches
- Updates database size display after cleanup

## Files Modified
- `/server/index.js` - Implemented proper cleanup endpoint at line 1326

## Testing
The cleanup functionality now:
1. Properly identifies orphaned files by checking all canvas data
2. Removes files from both the database and filesystem
3. Cleans up related thumbnails and transcodes
4. Provides detailed feedback about what was cleaned up
5. Updates the database size display to show the results

## Usage
Click the "Clean Up" button in the Canvas Navigator footer. You'll see a dialog with options:
- Run a dry run to preview what would be deleted
- Optionally delete all thumbnails (they'll be regenerated as needed)
- View detailed results after cleanup completes
