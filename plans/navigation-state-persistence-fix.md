# Navigation State Persistence Fix

## Issue
Navigation state (viewport position, zoom level, selected nodes) was only saving when the canvas was panned, not when other operations were performed (node moves, resizes, rotations, selections, etc.).

## Root Cause
The `NavigationStateManager` hooks into viewport methods (pan, zoom) to trigger saves, but it wasn't being triggered by node operations that don't affect the viewport directly.

## Solution
Added `window.navigationStateManager.onViewportChange()` calls after all relevant operations:

### Operations That Now Trigger Navigation State Save:

1. **Node Operations**
   - Node drag/move (line ~1563)
   - Node resize (line ~1617)
   - Node rotation (line ~1671)
   - Node deletion (line ~2281)
   - Node paste (line ~1987)

2. **Selection Changes**
   - Selection changes via `onSelectionChanged` (line ~562)

3. **Reset Operations**
   - Rotation reset via double-click (line ~431)
   - Aspect ratio reset via double-click (line ~484)

4. **Already Working**
   - Canvas pan
   - Canvas zoom (mouse wheel, keyboard)
   - View reset
   - Zoom to fit

## Implementation Details

The fix adds navigation state saves strategically after operations complete:
```javascript
// Save navigation state after [operation]
if (window.navigationStateManager) {
    console.log('üìç Saving navigation state after [operation]');
    window.navigationStateManager.onViewportChange();
}
```

## Why This Keeps Coming Back

This issue recurs because:
1. New features get added without considering navigation state persistence
2. The navigation state system isn't integrated at the core operation level
3. Developers expect it to "just work" but it requires explicit saves

## Future Prevention

Consider:
1. Integrating navigation state saves into the OperationPipeline
2. Adding a centralized "operation completed" event that triggers saves
3. Documentation reminding developers to add navigation state saves for new features

## Testing

1. Perform any node operation (move, resize, rotate, etc.)
2. Reload the page
3. Navigation state should be restored with the same viewport and selection
4. No need to pan the canvas for state to save
