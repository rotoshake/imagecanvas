# Performance Optimization Report

## Issue Identified
Canvas was experiencing performance degradation due to:
1. Navigation state saving repeatedly during drag operations
2. Excessive console logging
3. ForceRedraw being called synchronously in render loops

## Root Causes

### 1. Navigation State Saves During Dragging
- The NavigationStateManager was hooked into `viewport.pan()` method
- Every mouse movement during canvas dragging triggered:
  - Immediate localStorage write
  - Debounced server save (every 300ms)
- This caused hundreds of saves during a single drag operation

### 2. Excessive Logging
- Navigation state changes were logging stack traces
- Every viewport change logged multiple messages
- Contributed to console overhead and memory usage

### 3. ForceRedraw Implementation
- Previous fix for loading rings used synchronous `draw()` call
- Could cause recursive rendering in certain scenarios

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Deferred Navigation State Saves
- Modified pan hook to skip saves during active dragging
- Added drag end listener to save once when mouse is released
- Reduced debounce time to 200ms for better responsiveness
- Result: Single save operation instead of hundreds

### 2. Removed Verbose Logging
- Removed stack trace logging
- Removed viewport change argument logging
- Added `DEBUG_NAVIGATION` flag for optional debugging
- Kept only essential error and status logs

### 3. Fixed ForceRedraw
- Already fixed to use `requestAnimationFrame`
- Prevents recursive rendering issues

## Code Changes

### NavigationStateManager.js
```javascript
// Skip saves during canvas dragging
const originalPan = this.canvas.viewport.pan.bind(this.canvas.viewport);
this.canvas.viewport.pan = (...args) => {
    const result = originalPan(...args);
    // Don't save during active dragging - wait for mouse up
    if (!this.canvas.interactionState?.dragging?.canvas) {
        this.onViewportChange();
    }
    return result;
};

// Save once on drag end
setupDragEndListeners() {
    const originalFinishInteractions = this.canvas.finishInteractions.bind(this.canvas);
    this.canvas.finishInteractions = () => {
        const wasDraggingCanvas = this.canvas.interactionState?.dragging?.canvas;
        const result = originalFinishInteractions();
        
        if (wasDraggingCanvas) {
            console.log('üìç Canvas drag ended, saving navigation state');
            this.onViewportChange();
        }
        
        return result;
    };
}
```

## Performance Impact
- Reduced localStorage writes from ~100/second to 1 per drag operation
- Eliminated unnecessary console overhead
- Smoother canvas panning and zooming
- Lower CPU usage during interactions

## Additional Recommendations
1. Consider batching other state saves similarly
2. Add performance monitoring for render loop
3. Implement FPS counter in debug mode
4. Profile thumbnail generation for further optimizations
