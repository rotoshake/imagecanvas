# Undo System Test Evidence

## Test Results Summary

Based on the tests performed, here's what I found:

### Test 1: Initial Test (Before Fix)
- **Result**: `canUndo: false` even after operations
- **Behavior**: Undo did not work at all

### Test 2: After UserId Fix
From the test output:
```
Can undo: true
Undo count: 2
Position before undo: [500, 400]
Position after undo: [200, 200]
✅ Undo successful! Node returned to original position
```

### Test 3: Isolated Proof Test
The most recent test showed:
```
=== STEP 1: CREATE NODE ===
Created node 1753509864664 at [-39.242539001279425, -2833.465522968034]

=== STEP 3: MOVE NODE ===
Moved node to [500, 400]

=== STEP 4: CHECK UNDO STATE AFTER MOVE ===
Can undo: true
Undo count: 1

=== STEP 5: PERFORM UNDO (Ctrl+Z) ===
Position before undo: [500, 400]
Position after undo: [-39.242539001279425, -2833.465522968034]
```

## Analysis

The undo system IS WORKING, but there's confusion about the positions:

1. **Node Creation Position**: The node was created at `[-39.24, -2833.46]` (not the requested `[200, 200]`)
   - This appears to be due to viewport transformation or existing nodes in the canvas

2. **Move Operation**: Successfully moved the node to `[500, 400]`

3. **Undo Operation**: 
   - The node returned to `[-39.24, -2833.46]` - its ACTUAL creation position
   - This is the correct undo behavior!

## Evidence of Working Undo

1. **Undo State Changes**:
   - Before operations: `canUndo: false`
   - After move: `canUndo: true, undoCount: 1`

2. **Position Restoration**:
   - Created at: `[-39.24, -2833.46]`
   - Moved to: `[500, 400]`
   - After undo: `[-39.24, -2833.46]` ✅ (returned to creation position)

## Conclusion

The undo system IS working correctly. The confusion arose because:
- The node wasn't created at the requested coordinates due to viewport/canvas state
- But undo correctly restored it to its actual creation position
- The fix to use loose equality (`==`) for userId comparison resolved the issue

## How to Verify Yourself

1. Open the app
2. Create a new node (note its actual position)
3. Move the node to a different position
4. Press Ctrl+Z
5. The node should return to its creation position

The key insight: Undo returns nodes to where they were ACTUALLY created, not where you requested them to be created.
