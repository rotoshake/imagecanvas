# Undo Operations Status Report

## Current Status

### Working Operations ✅
- **node_move**: Fully functional - single Ctrl+Z restores position correctly

### Non-Working Operations ❌
- **node_resize**: Command executes, undo data prepared, but undo doesn't restore original size
- **node_rotate**: Command executes, undo data prepared, but undo doesn't restore original rotation
- **node_property_update**: Command executes, undo data prepared, but undo doesn't restore original property
- **node_delete**: Command executes, undo data prepared, but undo doesn't restore deleted node

## Analysis

All commands are:
1. ✅ Properly registered in OperationPipeline
2. ✅ Have prepareUndoData methods implemented
3. ✅ Generate undo data successfully
4. ✅ Send to server with undo data
5. ✅ Server responds with success
6. ❌ But the actual undo operation doesn't restore the original state

## Possible Causes

1. **Server-side undo implementation**: The server might not be correctly applying the undo operations for these command types
2. **Undo data format mismatch**: The undo data structure might not match what the server expects
3. **Command execution path**: These commands might follow a different execution path than node_move

## Next Steps

1. Check server-side undo handling for these specific operations
2. Verify the undo data format matches server expectations
3. Test if the issue is client-side or server-side by checking what state changes are broadcast after undo
4. Compare the implementation of node_move (working) with other operations to find differences

## Test Evidence

From test output:
```
=== REGISTERED COMMANDS ===
Commands: [
  'node_move',
  'node_create', 
  'node_delete',
  'node_property_update',
  'node_resize',
  'node_reset',
  'node_rotate',
  'video_toggle',
  'node_batch_property_update',
  'node_duplicate',
  'node_paste',
  'image_upload_complete'
]
```

All commands show:
- "✅ Command [type] already has undo data"
- "✅ Undo successful: JSHandle@object"
- "✅ State changes applied to graph"

But only move actually restores the correct state.
