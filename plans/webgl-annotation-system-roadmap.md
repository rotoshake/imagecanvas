# WebGL Annotation System Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the implementation of a WebGL-based drawing annotation system for ImageCanvas, utilizing SDF (Signed Distance Field) rendering for high-quality strokes that maintain quality at any zoom level. The system will integrate with the existing WebGL renderer and caching infrastructure.

## Technical Approach
- **Storage**: Vector format (points, curves, metadata)
- **Rendering**: SDF-based with texture caching
- **Compositing**: Multi-pass rendering with annotation layer
- **Performance**: LOD-aware caching, shared memory management

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

### 1.1 Data Model & Storage Structure
- Define annotation stroke data format (points, pressure, color, brush type)
- Add annotations array to ImageNode properties
- Create annotation operation types for network sync
- Extend database schema for annotation persistence

### 1.2 Basic WebGL Infrastructure
- Create annotation shader programs (vertex + fragment)
- Implement basic SDF stroke rendering
- Add annotation texture cache to WebGLRenderer
- Set up framebuffer for annotation layer rendering

### 1.3 Simple Drawing Input
- Create basic mouse/touch event capture
- Generate stroke point data from input
- Implement simple line interpolation
- Add temporary stroke preview during drawing

## Phase 2: Core Rendering (Week 2)

### 2.1 SDF-Based Stroke Rendering
- Implement distance field calculation for lines
- Add quadratic bezier curve support
- Create brush profile functions (hard/soft)
- Implement variable width based on pressure

### 2.2 Multi-Pass Compositing
- Modify drawNode() to check for annotations
- Render annotations to separate texture
- Composite annotation layer over color-corrected image
- Integrate with existing cache system

### 2.3 Caching Strategy
- Implement LOD-aware annotation caching
- Share memory budget with color correction cache
- Add cache invalidation on annotation changes
- Create cache key system for annotations

## Phase 3: Drawing Tools (Week 3)

### 3.1 Brush System
- Create brush presets (pen, marker, airbrush)
- Implement hardness/softness controls
- Add brush size and opacity settings
- Create eraser tool (destination-out blending)

### 3.2 Drawing UI Controls
- Create floating annotation toolbar
- Add color picker integration
- Implement brush size slider
- Add opacity control
- Create brush preset buttons

### 3.3 Stroke Optimization
- Implement stroke simplification (Douglas-Peucker)
- Add stroke smoothing during input
- Optimize point density based on speed
- Implement pressure curve adjustment

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)

### 4.1 Texture Support
- Add textured brush capability
- Implement brush texture atlas
- Create paper texture effects
- Add blend modes for brushes

### 4.2 Performance Optimization
- Implement adaptive quality (SDF vs cached)
- Add dirty region tracking
- Optimize shader performance
- Implement stroke batching

### 4.3 Collaborative Features
- Sync annotations across users
- Add annotation authorship tracking
- Implement conflict resolution
- Create annotation layers per user

## Phase 5: Polish & Integration (Week 5)

### 5.1 Undo/Redo Support
- Integrate with existing undo system
- Group stroke points into single undo
- Add annotation-specific undo operations
- Handle collaborative undo conflicts

### 5.2 Import/Export
- Export annotations with image
- Save annotations separately
- Import SVG paths as annotations
- Support annotation-only export

### 5.3 Testing & Refinement
- Performance profiling
- Memory usage optimization
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile/tablet optimization

## Technical Milestones

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **Start with Phase 1.1-1.3**: Get basic drawing working end-to-end
2. **Then Phase 2.1-2.2**: Implement quality rendering
3. **Follow with Phase 3.1-3.2**: Add essential UI and tools
4. **Continue to Phase 2.3 & 3.3**: Optimize performance
5. **Complete Phase 4 & 5**: Add advanced features

## Technical Specifications

### Annotation Data Structure
```javascript
{
  annotations: [{
    id: 'unique-id',
    strokes: [{
      points: [[x, y, pressure], ...],
      color: [r, g, b, a],
      brushType: 'pen' | 'marker' | 'airbrush',
      width: number,
      hardness: 0.0 - 1.0,
      opacity: 0.0 - 1.0,
      timestamp: number
    }],
    authorId: 'user-id',
    created: timestamp,
    modified: timestamp
  }]
}
```

### Shader Architecture
```glsl
// Vertex shader: Position bounding quads for strokes
// Fragment shader: Evaluate SDF and apply brush profile

uniform float brushHardness; // 0.0 = soft, 1.0 = hard
uniform float brushRadius;
uniform float brushFeather;

float brushProfile(float distance) {
    // SDF-based brush evaluation
    // Supports both hard and soft edges
}
```

### Caching Strategy
```javascript
// Cache key format
const cacheKey = `${nodeId}_annotations_${lodLevel}_${hash}`;

// Memory sharing with color corrections
const annotationMemoryBudget = totalMemory * 0.3; // 30% for annotations
const colorCorrectionBudget = totalMemory * 0.3; // 30% for color corrections
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risk
- **Mitigation**: Start with cached texture approach, add real-time SDF rendering as optimization
- **Fallback**: Use pre-rendered textures for low-end devices

### Memory Risk
- **Mitigation**: Reuse existing cache infrastructure and memory management
- **Monitoring**: Track GPU memory usage, implement automatic quality reduction

### Complexity Risk
- **Mitigation**: Build incrementally, test each phase before proceeding
- **Validation**: Create test suite for each milestone

### Compatibility Risk
- **Mitigation**: Test WebGL 1.0 fallbacks early
- **Alternative**: Canvas 2D fallback for unsupported browsers

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: Maintain 60fps during drawing and playback
2. **Quality**: Strokes remain crisp at all zoom levels
3. **Memory**: Stay within GPU memory budget (512MB desktop, 128MB mobile)
4. **Collaboration**: Real-time sync with <100ms latency
5. **Usability**: Intuitive drawing interface with <50ms input latency
