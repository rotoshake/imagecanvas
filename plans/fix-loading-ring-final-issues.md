# Fix Loading Ring Final Issues - Screen Space Width & Jittering

## Problems
1. Loading ring width wasn't staying consistent at 4px screen space
2. Progress animation was still jittering during transitions

## Root Causes

### 1. Screen Space Width Issue
The previous fix incorrectly removed the scale compensation. Since the canvas context is already scaled by `ctx.scale(viewport.scale)`, we DO need to compensate with `/scale` to maintain consistent screen-space width.

### 2. Jittering Issue
Multiple factors caused jittering:
- Progress values jumping between different phases (image loading â†’ thumbnail generation)
- No smoothing mechanism for progress updates
- Multiple rapid redraws triggered during loading
- Progress could jump backwards when switching from image to thumbnail progress

## Solutions

### 1. Fixed Screen Space Width
```javascript
// Corrected in base-node.js:
const scale = this.graph?.canvas?.viewport?.scale || 1;
const lineWidth = 4 / scale; // Compensate for canvas scaling
```

### 2. Added Progress Smoothing
Added a new `displayedProgress` variable that smoothly tracks the actual progress:

```javascript
// In constructor:
this.displayedProgress = 0; // Smoothed progress for display

// In draw method:
// Smooth the progress display to prevent jittering
// Only allow progress to increase, never decrease
if (targetProgress > this.displayedProgress) {
    // Quick catch-up for large jumps, smooth for small changes
    const diff = targetProgress - this.displayedProgress;
    if (diff > 0.3) {
        this.displayedProgress = targetProgress; // Jump for large changes
    } else {
        this.displayedProgress = Math.min(targetProgress, this.displayedProgress + 0.05); // Smooth small changes
    }
}
```

### 3. Additional Fixes
- Reset `thumbnailProgress` to 0 when starting new loads
- Added check to not show loading ring if `thumbnailProgress >= 1.0`
- Ensured progress only moves forward, never backwards

## Result
- **Consistent 4px screen width**: Ring maintains proper width at all zoom levels
- **Smooth progress animation**: No more jittering or jumping
- **Better visual feedback**: Progress smoothly fills from 0-100% for each phase
- **No backwards progress**: Display progress can only increase

## Technical Details
The smoothing algorithm:
- Large jumps (>30%): Immediate update to avoid lag
- Small changes (<30%): Smooth increment by max 5% per frame
- Progress can only increase, preventing backwards jumps
- Separate tracking for display vs actual progress values
