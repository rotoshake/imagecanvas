# Undo System Fix - Success Report

## Problem Summary
The undo system was reporting `canUndo: false` even after operations were executed, preventing users from undoing any actions.

## Root Cause
**Type Mismatch in UserId Comparison**

In `/server/src/undo/OperationHistory.js`, the userId comparison was using strict equality (`===`):
```javascript
if (op && op.userId === userId && op.state === 'applied')
```

The issue was:
- Operations were stored with numeric userIds (e.g., `1130`)
- But compared against string userIds (e.g., `"1130"`)
- Strict equality failed: `1130 === "1130"` is `false`

## Solution Implemented

Changed to loose equality (`==`) to handle the type mismatch:
```javascript
if (op && op.userId == userId && op.state === 'applied')
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- `canUndo: false` (always)
- Undo operations did not work
- Required multiple Ctrl+Z presses with no effect

### After Fix
- `canUndo: true, undoCount: 2` (correctly shows undoable operations)
- Single Ctrl+Z successfully undoes operations
- Node returned to original position `[200,200]` from `[400,300]`
- Redo also available after undo

## Verification Steps

1. Created a text node at position `[200, 200]`
2. Moved the node to position `[400, 300]`
3. Checked undo state: `canUndo: true, undoCount: 2`
4. Pressed Ctrl+Z once
5. Node returned to original position `[200, 200]`
6. Final state: `canUndo: true, undoCount: 1, canRedo: true`

## Technical Details

The fix was minimal but critical:
- File: `/server/src/undo/OperationHistory.js`
- Line: 212
- Change: `op.userId === userId` → `op.userId == userId`

This allows JavaScript's type coercion to handle the string/number mismatch automatically.

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - The undo system now works correctly with single Ctrl+Z presses and maintains proper operation order.
