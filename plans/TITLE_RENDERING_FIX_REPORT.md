# Title Rendering Fix Report

## Issue Summary
Image node titles were not displaying on the canvas despite being properly saved to the server and shown in logs as being drawn.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Incorrect Coordinate Transformation
**Problem**: The `drawNodeTitle` method was using manual coordinate calculations instead of the viewport's conversion method:
```javascript
// INCORRECT (old code)
const screenX = (drawPos[0] - this.viewport.offset[0]) * this.viewport.scale;
const screenY = (titleY - this.viewport.offset[1]) * this.viewport.scale;
```

**Fix**: Use the viewport's `convertGraphToOffset` method:
```javascript
// CORRECT (fixed code)
const [screenX, screenY] = this.viewport.convertGraphToOffset(drawPos[0], titleY);
```

### 2. Drawing Order Issue
**Problem**: `drawNodeTitle` was called inside the node's transform context (after `ctx.save()` and transforms but before `ctx.restore()`), which could cause double-transformation or clipping issues.

**Fix**: Moved `drawNodeTitle` call after `ctx.restore()` to ensure titles are drawn in a clean transform state.

## Changes Made

### File: `/js/canvas.js`

1. **Line 3339**: Changed coordinate conversion to use viewport method
2. **Lines 3215-3218**: Moved title drawing outside the node's transform context

## Test Results

### Test Suite Created
1. **test-title-rendering.html** - Basic title rendering tests
2. **test-title-issue.html** - Coordinate transform analysis
3. **verify-title-fix.html** - Before/after comparison
4. **test-final-verification.html** - Comprehensive verification

### Key Findings
- Titles now render correctly above image nodes
- Coordinate transformation properly converts world to screen space
- Titles respect zoom levels and hide when nodes are too small (<40px)
- Shadow effects work correctly for visibility on dark backgrounds

## Verification Steps

1. **Visual Verification**:
   - Open the application and add image nodes
   - Titles should appear above nodes in white text with shadow
   - Zoom in/out to verify titles scale properly
   - At very small zoom levels, titles should auto-hide

2. **Console Testing**:
   - Run `.scratch/test-titles.js` in browser console
   - Verify coordinate calculations are correct
   - Check that `drawNodeTitle` is being called

3. **Test Files**:
   - Open test HTML files to see isolated rendering tests
   - Compare old vs new coordinate calculation methods
   - Verify titles appear in correct positions

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Performance**: Title rendering adds minimal overhead as it's only text drawing
2. **Customization**: Future enhancement could add title styling options
3. **Truncation**: Long titles are properly truncated with ellipsis
4. **Rotation**: Titles remain horizontal even when nodes are rotated

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Titles now render correctly above image nodes on the canvas
