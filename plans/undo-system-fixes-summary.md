# Undo System Fixes Summary

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. User/Project ID Synchronization ✅
- **Issue**: Client was using hardcoded userId of 1 while server generated different user IDs
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `getOrCreateUserId()` method to CanvasNavigator that generates and stores a unique user ID in localStorage
  - Updated NetworkLayer to use the correct user ID when joining projects
  - Updated ClientUndoManager to properly track user/project IDs from server responses

### 2. Missing prepareUndoData Methods ✅
- **Issue**: DuplicateNodesCommand and PasteNodesCommand were missing prepareUndoData methods
- **Fix**:
  - Added prepareUndoData methods to both commands
  - Fixed property names (createdNodes -> createdNodeIds) for consistency
  - Ensured undo data is generated before operations are sent to server

### 3. Operation Validation ✅
- **Issue**: Commands without prepareUndoData would fail silently
- **Fix**:
  - Added validation in StateSyncManager to check for missing prepareUndoData
  - Shows warning to user when an operation may not be undoable
  - Logs critical errors to console for debugging

### 4. Enhanced Server Logging ✅
- **Issue**: Difficult to debug why operations weren't showing in undo state
- **Fix**:
  - Added comprehensive logging to handleRequestUndoState
  - Added logging to handleExecuteOperation to track operation recording
  - Added logging to show when undo state is sent to clients

### 5. Debug Tools ✅
- **Issue**: No easy way to test and debug the undo system
- **Fix**:
  - Created debug-undo-system.html tool that opens in a popup
  - Shows real-time undo state and system status
  - Provides buttons to test create, undo, and redo operations

## Investigation Results

### Why Clicking Doesn't Add Undo States
- Selection changes (clicking) do NOT trigger operations
- Only actual modifications (move, create, delete, etc.) create undoable operations
- This is the correct behavior

### Why Existing Operations May Not Show in Undo State
Possible causes:
1. Operations created before proper user ID was set
2. Operations stored with different user/project IDs than current session
3. Browser cache preventing updated code from loading

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear browser cache** to ensure all code updates are loaded
2. **Open the debug tool**:
   ```javascript
   window.open('/.scratch/debug-undo-system.html', 'undo-debug', 'width=600,height=800')
   ```
3. **Test the undo system**:
   - Click "Create Test Node" to add a node
   - Click "Request Undo State" to check if undo is available
   - Click "Perform Undo" to undo the creation
   - Monitor server logs for detailed operation tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor server logs** with the new logging to identify any remaining issues
2. **Test with fresh browser session** to ensure user ID synchronization works
3. **Add sequence numbers** to prevent operation order scrambling (still pending)
4. **Create automated tests** for the undo system (still pending)

## Success Indicators

- Creating a node shows `canUndo: true` in the debug tool
- Server logs show operations being recorded with undo data
- Undo successfully removes created nodes
- User IDs are consistent across client and server
