# Undo System Fixes Summary

## Overview
Successfully fixed the undo functionality for all node operations in the ImageCanvas collaborative system. Previously, only move operations were working properly.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Client-Server Undo Data Format Mismatch
The client commands were sending undo data in different formats than what the server expected.

**Solution**: Standardized all client commands to use the server's expected format:
- `previousPositions`: Object mapping nodeId -> position array
- `previousSizes`: Object mapping nodeId -> size array  
- `previousRotations`: Object mapping nodeId -> rotation value
- `previousProperties`: Object mapping nodeId -> properties object
- `deletedNodes`: Array of complete node data for deletion undo

### 2. Property Name Inconsistencies
Several commands had property name mismatches between `prepareUndoData()` and `undo()` methods:
- ResizeNodeCommand: `oldPosition` vs `oldPos`
- RotateNodeCommand: `oldPosition` vs `oldPos`

**Solution**: Fixed all property names to be consistent and match the new server format.

### 3. Server-Side Property Handling
The server was incorrectly applying all property updates to `node.properties` when some properties (like `title`) are direct node properties.

**Solution**: Updated server-side undo handlers to distinguish between:
- Direct node properties: `title`, `type`, `id`, `pos`, `size`, `rotation`, `flags`
- Nested properties: Everything else goes in `node.properties`

### 4. Local Undo Method Updates
The client-side undo methods were still using the old format after we changed the data structure.

**Solution**: Updated all undo methods to iterate through the new object-based format instead of array-based format.

## Commands Fixed

1. **ResizeNodeCommand**: 
   - Fixed undo data format
   - Fixed property name mismatches
   - Updated undo method

2. **RotateNodeCommand**:
   - Fixed undo data format  
   - Updated execute method for consistency
   - Updated undo method

3. **UpdateNodePropertyCommand**:
   - Fixed to use server format
   - Handles both direct and nested properties correctly
   - Updated undo method

4. **DeleteNodeCommand**:
   - Changed from `nodes` to `deletedNodes` array
   - Already had correct restoration logic

5. **MoveNodeCommand**:
   - Already working correctly
   - Uses both old and new format for compatibility

## Test Results

All operations now pass undo tests:
- ✅ Move
- ✅ Resize  
- ✅ Rotate
- ✅ Property Update (including title)
- ✅ Delete

## Next Steps

The following Phase 2 items from the audit are still pending:
1. User-specific undo and conflict resolution
2. Transaction grouping for bulk operations
3. Synchronization protocol for undo state
4. UI feedback improvements for undo operations
5. Offline/online transition handling
