# Handle Double-Click Optimistic Updates Fix

## The Complete Issue

When double-clicking on resize/rotation handles to reset aspect ratio or rotation, the changes weren't visible immediately because:

1. **Command Registration Issue** - `node_rotate` and `node_reset` commands weren't properly registered (fixed earlier)
2. **Server-Authoritative Sync** - Operations were waiting for server response before updating locally
3. **Server Response Overwrites** - When the server responded with the old state, it would overwrite the local optimistic updates

## Root Cause Analysis

The application uses a server-authoritative architecture where:
1. Local operations are sent to the server via `StateSyncManager`
2. The server processes the operation and sends back the updated state
3. The client applies the server state, which was overwriting local changes

The reset operations were executing on the server correctly, but the visual feedback was delayed because:
- The local state wasn't updated until the server responded
- When the server sent back intermediate state updates, they would overwrite any local changes

## Solution: Optimistic Updates

Implemented a three-part solution:

### 1. Execute Commands Locally First (OperationPipeline.js)
```javascript
// For certain UI operations, execute locally first for immediate feedback
const optimisticOperations = ['node_reset', 'node_rotate'];
if (optimisticOperations.includes(command.type)) {
    // Execute locally for immediate visual feedback
    await command.execute(context);
    
    // Mark affected nodes as having optimistic updates
    nodeIds.forEach(nodeId => {
        const node = this.app.graph.getNodeById(nodeId);
        if (node) {
            node._optimisticUpdate = {
                operationId: command.id,
                timestamp: Date.now(),
                type: command.type
            };
        }
    });
}
```

### 2. Skip Server Updates for Optimistic Nodes (StateSyncManager.js)
```javascript
updateNodeFromData(node, nodeData) {
    // Check if this node has a recent optimistic update
    if (node._optimisticUpdate) {
        const age = Date.now() - node._optimisticUpdate.timestamp;
        // Skip server updates for recent optimistic updates (within 2 seconds)
        if (age < 2000) {
            console.log(`⏭️ Skipping server update for node ${node.id}`);
            return;
        }
    }
    // ... continue with updates
}
```

### 3. Clear Flags When Server Confirms (StateSyncManager.js)
```javascript
// Clear optimistic update flags when server confirms the operation
if (operationId && changes?.updated) {
    changes.updated.forEach(nodeData => {
        const node = this.app.graph.getNodeById(nodeData.id);
        if (node && node._optimisticUpdate && 
            node._optimisticUpdate.operationId === operationId) {
            delete node._optimisticUpdate;
        }
    });
}
```

## How It Works

1. User double-clicks a handle
2. Command executes locally immediately (visual feedback)
3. Node is marked with `_optimisticUpdate` flag
4. Command is sent to server
5. Any server state updates for that node are ignored for 2 seconds
6. When server confirms with the correct operation ID, flag is cleared
7. Future server updates are applied normally

## Testing

1. Reload the application
2. Load an image node
3. Resize and double-click resize handle - immediate reset
4. Rotate and double-click rotation handle - immediate reset
5. No more waiting for server round-trip

The fix provides instant visual feedback while maintaining server authority and eventual consistency.
