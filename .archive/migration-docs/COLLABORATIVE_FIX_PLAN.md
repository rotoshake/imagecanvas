# Collaborative System Fix - Granular Step-by-Step Plan

## Current Problem
- Infinite loop when creating nodes (drag & drop or any creation)
- Previous fixes didn't work, indicating deeper architectural issues
- Testing tools aren't catching the real problems

## Step-by-Step Diagnostic and Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Accurate Diagnosis (Current Focus)

#### Step 1.1: Create Call Stack Tracer
- Inject a tracer that logs EVERY function call related to node creation
- Track the exact sequence of calls leading to the loop
- Include timestamps and call origins

#### Step 1.2: Identify All Node Creation Paths
- Map every way a node can be created in the system
- Trace what happens after each creation method
- Document all broadcast triggers

#### Step 1.3: Browser-Based Diagnostics
- Use Puppeteer with console interception
- Capture the exact console output during the loop
- Save full traces to analyze offline

### Phase 2: Component Isolation Testing

#### Step 2.1: Test Node Creation WITHOUT Collaboration
- Disable collaborative features entirely
- Verify basic node creation works
- Ensure no loops in single-player mode

#### Step 2.2: Test Broadcast Mechanism Alone
- Create a minimal broadcast test
- Send operations without executing them
- Verify no echo/loop in messaging

#### Step 2.3: Test Operation Reception Alone  
- Simulate receiving remote operations
- Apply them without broadcasting
- Verify no recursive calls

### Phase 3: Systematic Fix Implementation

#### Step 3.1: Implement Operation Deduplication
- Add operation IDs that persist through the full cycle
- Track operations to prevent re-execution
- Log when duplicates are detected

#### Step 3.2: Separate Local vs Remote Execution Paths
- Clear distinction between local and remote operations
- Ensure local operations are NEVER re-executed
- Add guards at every potential loop point

#### Step 3.3: Fix Integration Points
- Fix one integration at a time
- Test after each fix
- Roll back if issues persist

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Verification

#### Step 4.1: Automated Loop Detection
- Script that monitors for repeated operations
- Automatic failure if loop detected
- Clear reporting of loop location

#### Step 4.2: Multi-Scenario Testing
- Test all node creation methods
- Test with multiple clients
- Test with network delays

#### Step 4.3: Performance Verification
- Ensure no performance degradation
- Monitor memory usage
- Check for any leaks

## Implementation Order

1. **FIRST**: Build accurate diagnostic tools that actually work
2. **THEN**: Use diagnostics to find the real problem
3. **FINALLY**: Fix based on actual data, not assumptions

## Success Criteria

- Zero infinite loops in any scenario
- Clean console output (no spam)
- All collaborative features working
- Verified with automated tests that actually catch issues
