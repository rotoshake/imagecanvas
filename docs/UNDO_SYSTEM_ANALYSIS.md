# Undo System Analysis - Non-Uniform Resize Issue

## Summary
The user reported that "non uniform resizes aren't going to the undo". After thorough investigation, I've found that:

1. **The code structure is correct** - ResizeNodeCommand properly creates undoData
2. **The command is registered** - node_resize is registered in OperationPipeline
3. **The operation is executed** - Resize operations go through the proper command pipeline

## Key Findings

### 1. Resize Operation Flow
When a user resizes a node:
1. Mouse down on resize handle → `startResize()` sets up resize state
2. Mouse move → `updateResize()` directly modifies node size (for visual feedback)
3. Mouse up → `finishInteractions()` executes the `node_resize` command

### 2. Potential Issue
The resize command IS being executed (lines 1220/1235 in canvas.js), but it might not be captured due to:
- Timing issues with interceptor setup
- The `wasInteracting` check might be false
- The operation might be missing required metadata

### 3. Debug Logging Added
I've added console logging to track:
- When resize operations finish: `🎯 Finishing resize operation`
- When resize command executes: `📐 Executing node_resize`
- Inside ResizeNodeCommand: `🎯 ResizeNodeCommand.execute`
- When command completes: `✅ ResizeNodeCommand.executed = true`

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Browser Test
1. Open the browser console
2. Run: `.scratch/test-resize-undo.js`
3. This will test both uniform and non-uniform resize

### Manual Test
1. Create or select a node
2. Drag corner handle WITHOUT holding Shift (non-uniform resize)
3. Watch console for:
   - `🎯 Finishing resize operation`
   - `📐 Executing node_resize`
   - `🎯 applyOptimistic interceptor`
   - `✅ Capturing command immediately`
4. Press Ctrl+Z immediately
5. Node should return to original size

### Comprehensive Test
Run `.scratch/test-all-operations-undo.js` to test ALL operations:
- node_create ✅
- node_move ✅
- node_resize (uniform) ✅
- node_resize (non-uniform) ❓
- node_rotate ✅
- node_property_update ✅
- node_delete ✅

## Next Steps

If resize operations are still not being captured:

1. **Check wasInteracting flag**
   - The resize might not be considered an "interaction"
   - Solution: Remove the wasInteracting check for resize

2. **Check timing**
   - The interceptor might not be ready
   - Solution: Force interceptor setup earlier

3. **Check operation metadata**
   - The command might be missing origin or other required fields
   - Solution: Log all command properties

## Code Changes Made

1. Added debug logging to canvas.js (lines 1210, 1222, 1234)
2. Added debug logging to ResizeNodeCommand (lines 31-35, 82)
3. Created test scripts in .scratch/
4. Created documentation in docs/

The logging will help identify exactly where the issue occurs in the resize → undo flow.
