# Undo System Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Move Operation Delay**: Operations were only captured after server round-trip (2+ seconds)
2. **Rotation Not Working**: Rotation operations weren't being captured at all
3. **Bundled Actions**: Bundling logic not implemented (TODO stubs)

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Immediate Operation Capture
**Problem**: The undo system was waiting for the full server round-trip before capturing operations, causing a 2+ second delay.

**Root Cause**: 
- Operations go through: OperationPipeline → StateSyncManager → applyOptimistic (local execution) → server round-trip → interceptor
- The interceptor only ran after the entire flow completed

**Solution**: 
- Added interceptor to `applyOptimistic` method in StateSyncManager
- Now captures operations immediately after local execution
- Operations are added to undo history before server confirmation

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// In CollaborativeUndoRedoManager.js
this.app.stateSyncManager.applyOptimistic = async function(command) {
    const result = await originalApplyOptimistic.call(this, command);
    
    // Capture immediately after local execution
    if (command.executed && command.undoData && command.origin === 'local') {
        undoManager.captureExecutedCommand(command);
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### 2. Fixed Image Upload Undo
**Problem**: Double node creation caused undo to reference wrong node IDs

**Solution**: 
- Modified dragdrop.js to use operation pipeline from the start
- Updated CreateNodeCommand to handle background uploads
- Single node creation = single undo operation

## Still To Do

### 1. Implement Operation Bundling
The bundling methods are currently TODO stubs:
```javascript
addToBundle(operation) {
    // TODO: Implement bundling
    this.addToCurrentUserHistory(operation);
}

finalizePendingBundle() {
    // TODO: Implement bundling
}
```

Need to implement:
- Bundle related operations (e.g., create + move for Alt+drag)
- Bundle rapid same-type operations
- Bundle alignment operations

### 2. Test Rotation Operations
- Verify rotation operations are now captured immediately
- Test multi-node rotation
- Test rotation with undo/redo

### 3. Handle Edge Cases
- Operations that fail on server but succeed locally
- Network disconnection during operation
- Conflicting operations from multiple users

## Testing

Created test scripts in `.scratch/`:
- `test-undo-timing.js` - Tests operation capture timing
- `test-undo-comprehensive.js` - Full undo system test suite
- `test-undo-manual.md` - Manual testing instructions

## Next Steps

1. Implement operation bundling for better UX
2. Add debouncing for rapid operations
3. Consider adding operation merging (e.g., multiple small moves → one move)
4. Add visual feedback when operations are being processed
