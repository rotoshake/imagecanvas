# Copy/Paste Fix Summary

## Problem
When copying and pasting large amounts of nodes, some nodes were being silently dropped due to failed chunks not being tracked properly in the BulkOperationManager.

## Root Cause
When a chunk failed during bulk operations, the error was logged but no result was added to the `chunkResults` array. This meant failed nodes were completely lost and not reported to the user.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Track Failed Chunks (BulkOperationManager.js)
- Failed chunks now push a result object with empty nodes array and error details
- This ensures we don't lose track of which nodes failed
- Failed nodes are now included in the error count

### 2. Retry Logic for Failed Chunks
Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff:
- `MAX_RETRIES = 2` - Each chunk gets up to 3 attempts total
- `RETRY_DELAY = 1000ms` - Initial retry delay
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s delays between retries
- Only final failure after all retries results in dropped nodes

### 3. Improved User Notifications
- Shows exact count of successful vs failed nodes
- Example: "Pasted 85 of 100 nodes. 15 nodes failed."
- Warning notification when any nodes fail
- Success notification shows actual count pasted

### 4. Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive logging throughout the copy/paste flow:
- Copy operation logs node count and types
- Paste operation logs start and completion
- Failed chunks log retry attempts
- Final result logs successful node count

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Normal Copy/Paste**:
   - Select 5-10 nodes
   - Copy (Ctrl+C) and Paste (Ctrl+V)
   - Should work as before with success notification

2. **Test Large Copy/Paste**:
   - Select 50+ nodes
   - Copy and Paste
   - Watch console for chunk processing logs
   - Verify notification shows correct count

3. **Test with Network Issues**:
   - Select 100+ nodes
   - Throttle network in DevTools (Slow 3G)
   - Copy and Paste
   - Should see retry attempts in console
   - Failed nodes should be reported in notification

4. **Verify Error Handling**:
   - Temporarily break server endpoint
   - Try large copy/paste
   - Should see all retries fail
   - Notification should report all nodes failed

## What Users Will See

### Before Fix
- Copy 100 nodes → Paste → Only 85 appear
- No indication that 15 nodes were lost
- Silent data loss

### After Fix
- Copy 100 nodes → Paste
- If all succeed: "Successfully pasted 100 nodes"
- If some fail: "Pasted 85 of 100 nodes. 15 nodes failed."
- Console shows which chunks failed and why
- Retry attempts happen automatically

## Future Improvements

1. **Selective Retry**: Retry only the failed items within a chunk rather than the entire chunk
2. **Progress Bar**: For very large operations (1000+ nodes), show a progress bar
3. **Recovery Options**: Give users the option to retry failed nodes manually
4. **Batch Size Optimization**: Dynamically adjust chunk size based on success rate

## Configuration

Current settings in BulkOperationManager:
- `CHUNK_SIZE = 10` - Nodes per chunk
- `MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE = 2MB` - Max size per chunk
- `OPERATION_TIMEOUT = 15s` - Timeout per chunk
- `MAX_RETRIES = 2` - Retry attempts per chunk
- `RETRY_DELAY = 1000ms` - Initial retry delay

These can be tuned based on performance requirements and network conditions.
