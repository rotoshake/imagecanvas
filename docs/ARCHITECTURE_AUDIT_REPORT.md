# ImageCanvas Architecture Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit reveals that while the new architecture in `js/core/` is well-designed, the system is in a dangerous state with **multiple competing architectures running simultaneously**, creating severe issues including data loss risks, security vulnerabilities, and memory leaks.

## Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. **Multiple Competing Systems**
- **4 different operation handling systems** are active simultaneously:
  - New OperationPipeline (well-designed but underutilized)
  - Legacy CollaborativeManager (still actively processing)
  - CanvasActionManager (separate action queue)
  - Direct broadcast methods (bypass all systems)
- **Result**: Race conditions, duplicate operations, inconsistent state

### 2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
- **No input validation** on any operations
- **XSS vulnerability** through text nodes (no sanitization)
- **No rate limiting** - vulnerable to DoS attacks
- **File upload issues**: 
  - Client-side validation only
  - No content verification
  - No size limits enforced server-side
  - No virus scanning

### 3. **Data Loss Risks**
- **Silent operation failures** on network errors
- **No retry mechanism** for failed operations
- **No operation buffering** during disconnections
- **Operations lost** during server outages
- **No conflict resolution** for concurrent edits

### 4. **Memory Leaks**
- **Circular references**:
  - Canvas ↔ Graph (strong references)
  - Node → Graph (cleaned up properly)
  - App ↔ CollaborativeManager
- **Unbounded caches**:
  - ThumbnailCache grows indefinitely
  - ImageCache has limit but no eviction
- **Event listener leaks**:
  - UI components add listeners without cleanup
  - Bound functions create new instances
  - Document-level listeners never removed

## Major Architectural Problems

### 1. **State Management Chaos**
- Multiple overlapping state systems
- No single source of truth
- State can be modified by any system
- No transaction isolation

### 2. **Missing Error Handling**
- Network failures cause silent data loss
- No user notification of errors
- Partial transaction failures leave inconsistent state
- No automatic recovery mechanisms

### 3. **Concurrency Issues**
- No operational transform implementation
- No CRDT for conflict resolution
- Out-of-order operations applied incorrectly
- Concurrent edits overwrite each other

### 4. **Performance Issues**
- Entire canvas redrawn on any change
- No dirty rectangle optimization
- Large files loaded entirely in memory
- No chunked upload support

## Positive Findings

### Well-Designed Components (in js/core/)
- **NetworkLayer.js** - Clean separation, proper session management
- **OperationPipeline.js** - Excellent command pattern with undo/redo
- **CollaborativeArchitecture.js** - Good orchestration design
- **MigrationAdapter.js** - Smart transition approach

The new architecture is actually well-designed - the problem is it's running alongside legacy systems instead of replacing them.

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Security & Data Loss)
1. **Disable legacy systems** - Route everything through OperationPipeline
2. **Add input validation** - Sanitize all operation data
3. **Implement operation buffering** - Queue operations during disconnection
4. **Add rate limiting** - Prevent DoS attacks
5. **Fix file upload security** - Server-side validation, size limits

### Short-term (Stability)
1. **Complete migration** to new architecture
2. **Add conflict resolution** - Implement operational transforms
3. **Fix memory leaks** - Use WeakMaps, add cleanup methods
4. **Add error notifications** - Inform users of failures
5. **Implement retry logic** - Automatic retry for failed operations

### Long-term (Performance & Scalability)
1. **Optimize rendering** - Implement dirty rectangles
2. **Add chunked uploads** - Handle large files properly
3. **Implement operation compression** - Reduce bandwidth
4. **Add monitoring** - Track performance and errors
5. **Create integration tests** - Ensure systems work together

## Conclusion

The project has a solid new architecture that's being undermined by running multiple systems simultaneously. The immediate priority should be to **commit fully to the new architecture** and disable all competing systems. This will resolve many of the race conditions and state inconsistency issues.

Security vulnerabilities and data loss risks require immediate attention. The lack of input validation and error handling creates serious risks for production use.

With focused effort on completing the migration and addressing the security issues, this could be a robust collaborative editing system. The foundation in `js/core/` is good - it just needs to be the *only* system running.
