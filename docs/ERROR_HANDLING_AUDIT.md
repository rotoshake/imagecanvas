# ImageCanvas Error Handling and Edge Cases Audit

## Executive Summary

This audit identifies critical vulnerabilities and missing error handling in the ImageCanvas collaborative canvas application. Several high-priority security issues and data consistency problems require immediate attention.

## 1. Critical Path Error Handling Analysis

### 1.1 Network Failures (NetworkLayer.js & collaborative.js)

#### Current Issues:
- **No retry mechanism with exponential backoff** - Failed operations are lost
- **Socket connection errors only logged** - No user notification or recovery
- **Missing network state persistence** - Operations lost during disconnections
- **No operation queue for offline mode**

#### Vulnerabilities:
```javascript
// NetworkLayer.js line 152-157
broadcast(command) {
    if (!this.isConnected) {
        console.warn('Cannot broadcast: not connected to server');
        return; // Operation silently dropped!
    }
```

### 1.2 Operation Validation (UnifiedOperationHandler.js)

#### Current Issues:
- **Basic validation only** - No deep property validation
- **No input sanitization** - XSS vulnerabilities in text nodes
- **Missing bounds checking** - Nodes can be positioned outside reasonable limits
- **No operation size limits** - DoS potential with large operations

#### Vulnerabilities:
```javascript
// Missing validation for malicious inputs
execute: async (data, app) => {
    const { nodeIds, positions } = data;
    // No validation that positions are reasonable numbers
    // No check for array size limits
    // No sanitization of node properties
```

### 1.3 File Upload/Processing (dragdrop.js)

#### Current Issues:
- **File type validation is client-side only**
- **No virus scanning**
- **Missing file content validation** - Malformed images can crash the app
- **No rate limiting on uploads**
- **Memory leaks with failed uploads**

#### Vulnerabilities:
```javascript
// dragdrop.js line 101-103
isValidFile(file) {
    return this.acceptedTypes.has(file.type); // MIME type can be spoofed!
}
```

### 1.4 WebSocket Disconnections/Reconnections

#### Current Issues:
- **Operation loss during reconnection** - No operation buffer
- **Race conditions during state sync**
- **No conflict resolution for simultaneous edits**
- **Missing heartbeat timeout handling**

#### Critical Gap:
```javascript
// collaborative.js - No operation buffering during disconnection
handleDisconnect(socket) {
    // Operations sent during disconnect are lost
    // No attempt to queue and resend
}
```

### 1.5 Transaction Rollbacks (TransactionManager.js)

#### Current Issues:
- **Partial rollback failures not handled** - Can leave inconsistent state
- **No deadlock detection**
- **Missing transaction timeout**
- **Checkpoint restoration can fail silently**

#### Vulnerability:
```javascript
// TransactionManager.js line 221-224
} catch (undoError) {
    console.error(`Failed to rollback operation ${i + 1}:`, undoError);
    // Continue with remaining rollbacks - INCONSISTENT STATE!
}
```

## 2. Edge Cases Analysis

### 2.1 Operations Arriving Out of Order

**Current State**: Sequence numbers assigned but not enforced
**Problem**: Operations can be applied in wrong order, causing:
- Node positions being overwritten incorrectly
- Delete operations failing because create hasn't arrived
- Properties being set on non-existent nodes

**Missing Implementation**:
```javascript
// Need operation queue with sequence enforcement
class OperationSequencer {
    constructor() {
        this.expectedSequence = 0;
        this.pendingOperations = new Map(); // sequence -> operation
    }
    
    processOperation(operation) {
        if (operation.sequence === this.expectedSequence) {
            this.apply(operation);
            this.expectedSequence++;
            this.processPending();
        } else {
            this.pendingOperations.set(operation.sequence, operation);
        }
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Conflicting Concurrent Operations

**Current State**: Last-write-wins with no conflict detection
**Problems**:
- User A moves node to position X, User B moves same node to position Y simultaneously
- Both resize the same node - unpredictable final size
- One user deletes while another edits

**Missing**: Operational Transform (OT) or CRDT implementation

### 2.3 Node Deleted While Being Edited

**Current State**: No locking or tombstoning
**Problems**:
- Property updates fail silently on deleted nodes
- No "deleted" state - operations just fail
- No undo capability for collaborative deletes

### 2.4 Large File Uploads

**Current State**: 50MB limit but no progress indication for other users
**Problems**:
- No chunked upload support
- Entire file loaded in memory (client & server)
- No resume capability for failed uploads
- Other users see node appear suddenly with no loading state

### 2.5 Server Down Mid-Operation

**Current State**: Operations lost, no recovery
**Critical Issues**:
- No local operation log
- No replay capability after reconnection  
- State divergence between clients
- No indication to user that operations failed

### 2.6 Malformed Operations

**Current State**: Basic try-catch, operations skipped
**Problems**:
```javascript
// collaborative.js line 214-216
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create command from remote operation:', error);
    // Operation silently dropped - state divergence!
}
```

## 3. Security Vulnerabilities

### 3.1 Input Validation

**CRITICAL**: No server-side validation of operations
```javascript
// Server collaboration.js - directly trusts client data
operation.sequence = ++room.sequenceNumber;
operation.userId = session.userId;
// No validation of operation.data contents!
```

### 3.2 XSS Prevention

**CRITICAL**: Text nodes render unsanitized content
- No HTML escaping in text node rendering
- Properties can contain script tags
- Node titles not sanitized

### 3.3 File Upload Validation

**HIGH**: Multiple vulnerabilities
- File type validation can be bypassed (MIME type spoofing)
- No file content verification
- No antivirus scanning
- Path traversal possible in filenames

### 3.4 Rate Limiting

**MISSING ENTIRELY**:
- No rate limiting on operations
- No rate limiting on uploads  
- No rate limiting on project creation
- DoS attacks possible

### 3.5 Size Limits

**PARTIAL**:
- 50MB file upload limit (good)
- No limit on operation size
- No limit on number of nodes
- No limit on canvas bounds
- Memory exhaustion attacks possible

## 4. Data Consistency Issues

### 4.1 Partial Operation Failures

**Current State**: No atomicity guarantees
**Problems**:
- Multi-node operations can partially fail
- No rollback for failed operations
- State divergence between server and clients

### 4.2 Multi-Step Operation Atomicity

**Current State**: TransactionManager exists but not used for all operations
**Gaps**:
- File upload + node creation not atomic
- Bulk operations not wrapped in transactions
- Network failures mid-transaction cause inconsistency

### 4.3 State Recovery After Errors

**Current State**: Manual refresh required
**Problems**:
- No automatic state reconciliation
- No checkpointing during long sessions
- Memory leaks from failed operations
- Orphaned event listeners

## 5. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0):

1. **Add Server-Side Input Validation**
```javascript
validateOperation(operation) {
    // Whitelist allowed operation types
    // Validate data types and ranges
    // Sanitize all string inputs
    // Check array sizes
}
```

2. **Implement XSS Protection**
```javascript
const DOMPurify = require('isomorphic-dompurify');
node.properties.text = DOMPurify.sanitize(inputText);
```

3. **Add Rate Limiting**
```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const uploadLimiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 10, // limit each IP to 10 uploads per window
    message: 'Too many uploads, please try again later'
});
```

4. **Operation Buffering During Disconnection**
```javascript
class OperationBuffer {
    constructor() {
        this.buffer = [];
        this.maxSize = 1000;
    }
    
    add(operation) {
        if (this.buffer.length >= this.maxSize) {
            this.buffer.shift(); // Remove oldest
        }
        this.buffer.push(operation);
    }
    
    flush() {
        const ops = [...this.buffer];
        this.buffer = [];
        return ops;
    }
}
```

### High Priority (P1):

1. **Implement Operation Sequencing**
2. **Add Conflict Resolution (OT/CRDT)**
3. **Server-Side File Validation**
4. **Transaction Timeout & Deadlock Detection**
5. **Automatic State Recovery**

### Medium Priority (P2):

1. **Chunked File Upload**
2. **Operation Size Limits**
3. **Canvas Bounds Enforcement**
4. **Comprehensive Error Notifications**
5. **Offline Mode Support**

## 6. Security Checklist

- [ ] Input validation on ALL user inputs
- [ ] XSS protection on text rendering
- [ ] CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] File upload security (type, size, content validation)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (using parameterized queries)
- [ ] Proper error messages (no stack traces to users)
- [ ] Secure session management
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers

## Conclusion

The ImageCanvas application has solid architectural foundations but requires immediate attention to security vulnerabilities and error handling gaps. The most critical issues are:

1. **No input validation** - Allows XSS and injection attacks
2. **No rate limiting** - Enables DoS attacks
3. **Silent operation failures** - Causes state divergence
4. **No conflict resolution** - Data loss in collaborative scenarios

Implementing the P0 recommendations should be the immediate focus to prevent data loss and security breaches.
