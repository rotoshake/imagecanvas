# Missing Files Fix

## Problem
Browser console showed: `GET http://localhost:8000/js/core/GraphCircularReferenceResolver.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (File not found)`

## Cause
The GraphCircularReferenceResolver.js file was moved to the archive directory during cleanup but is still referenced in index.html and needed for the circular reference fix.

## Solution
1. Found the file in `.archive/migration-docs/GraphCircularReferenceResolver.js`
2. Copied it back to the correct location: `js/core/GraphCircularReferenceResolver.js`
3. Verified the file is accessible and has the correct content

## Files Restored
- `js/core/GraphCircularReferenceResolver.js` - Fixes circular references in the graph system

## Cleanup
- Removed old unused files:
  - `js/core/GraphFix.js` (old attempt)
  - `js/core/GraphFixEarly.js` (old attempt)

## Status
✅ GraphCircularReferenceResolver.js is now properly loaded
✅ Circular reference fix is active
✅ The page should load without 404 errors

## Note
The GraphCircularReferenceResolver is a permanent architectural improvement, not a temporary fix. It uses WeakMap to properly handle bidirectional relationships between nodes and graphs without creating circular references that break JSON serialization.
