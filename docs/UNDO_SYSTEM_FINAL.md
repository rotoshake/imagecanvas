# Undo System - Final Implementation Status

## What I've Fixed

### 1. Immediate Operation Capture
- Added interceptor to `applyOptimistic` method in StateSyncManager
- Operations are now captured immediately after local execution
- No more waiting for server round-trip

### 2. Operation Bundling
- Implemented full bundling logic (was TODO)
- Operations within 100ms are bundled together
- Alt+drag (create + move) creates single undo entry

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging to track operation flow
- Shows when operations are captured or skipped
- Helps diagnose any remaining issues

## How to Test

### Quick Test Script
```javascript
// Paste this in console:
async function quickUndoTest() {
    console.log('Creating node...');
    const result = await app.operationPipeline.execute('node_create', {
        type: 'media/text',
        pos: [300, 300],
        size: [200, 50],
        properties: { content: 'Test' }
    });
    
    console.log('Waiting 100ms...');
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 100));
    
    console.log('Can undo?', app.undoRedoManager.getHistoryInfo().canUndo);
    console.log('History size:', app.undoRedoManager.getHistoryInfo().size);
    
    if (app.undoRedoManager.getHistoryInfo().canUndo) {
        console.log('‚úÖ Undo is ready immediately!');
    } else {
        console.log('‚ùå Undo not ready - check console for diagnostic logs');
    }
}

quickUndoTest();
```

### Manual Tests
1. **Move Test**: Drag a node and immediately press Ctrl+Z
2. **Rotate Test**: Rotate a node and immediately press Ctrl+Z  
3. **Bundle Test**: Alt+drag to duplicate and immediately press Ctrl+Z

## Diagnostic Tools

### 1. Check System State
```javascript
// Run diagnose-undo.js script
load('.scratch/diagnose-undo.js');
diagnoseUndo();
```

### 2. Force Setup Interceptors
```javascript
// If interceptors aren't set up:
forceSetupInterceptors();
```

### 3. Check Console Logs
Look for these key messages:
- `üéØ Interceptors set up` - Confirms interceptors initialized
- `üéØ applyOptimistic interceptor` - Shows operations flowing through
- `‚úÖ Capturing command immediately` - Confirms capture
- `‚è≠Ô∏è Not capturing` - Shows why operation was skipped

## Potential Issues

### 1. Timing Issue
The interceptors are set up with 100ms delay. If operations happen before this, they won't be captured immediately.

**Solution**: Increased delay to 100ms to ensure proper setup.

### 2. Optimistic Mode
The system only captures in optimistic mode. Check if enabled:
```javascript
console.log('Optimistic mode:', app.stateSyncManager?.optimisticEnabled);
```

### 3. Network State
Operations might behave differently when offline vs online.

## What You Should See

When everything works correctly:
1. Operations show up in history immediately (< 100ms)
2. Ctrl+Z works without any delay
3. Alt+drag creates one undo entry, not two
4. Console shows "Capturing command immediately" messages

## If It's Still Not Working

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Run the diagnostic script
3. Verify optimistic mode is enabled
4. Check if interceptors are properly set up
5. Look for timing issues in the logs

The fixes are implemented, but timing and initialization order can affect whether they work properly. The diagnostic tools will help identify any remaining issues.
